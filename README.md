# Multi Agent Meal Grocery Planner ðŸ¥—ðŸ›’ with CrewAI

**Meal Grocery Planner** is an AI-driven application designed to help users automatically generate weekly meal plans, organize grocery shopping lists, validate budget constraints, and suggest leftover usage.  
The system leverages [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai) to orchestrate multiple specialized **agents** working together in a collaborative workflow.

## Overview
The **Meal Grocery Planner** automates the process of:
- Generating personalized meal plans
- Organizing grocery items by categories
- Verifying adherence to a defined budget
- Minimizing waste via leftover reuse
- Summarizing all steps in a simple, consolidated report

This project demonstrates how **AI Agents** can collaborate under a Crew orchestrator to deliver real-world, production-ready solutions.

## Architecture
The workflow follows a **sequential process**:

1. **Meal Planner Agent**  
   Generates a structured meal plan (ingredients, servings, complexity).
   ![Meal planner](docs/screenshots/meal_plan.png)

2. **Shopping Organizer Agent**  
   Converts planned meals into a categorized shopping list by store sections.
    ![Shopping list](docs/screenshots/shopping_list.png)

3. **Budget Advisor Agent**  
   Checks the grocery list against the available budget and suggests optimizations.

4. **Leftover Agent**  
   Proposes leftover-based meals to reduce waste.

5. **Summary Agent**  
   Consolidates all results into a user-friendly output.

## Agents

### Meal Planner Agent
- **Purpose**: Creates weekly meal plans (names, servings, difficulty level, ingredients).
- **Output**: `meals.json`

### Shopping Organizer Agent
- **Purpose**: Organizes meals into shopping categories (e.g., Produce, Dairy, Meat).
- **Output**: `shopping_list.json`

### Budget Advisor Agent
- **Purpose**: Ensures the planned groceries respect the userâ€™s budget, suggests cheaper alternatives.
- **Output**: `shopping_guide.md`

### Leftover Agent
- **Purpose**: Generates ideas to reuse leftovers efficiently.
- **Output**: JSON/Markdown suggestions

### Summary Agent
- **Purpose**: Aggregates results from other agents into a final summary.
- **Output**: Markdown or JSON
