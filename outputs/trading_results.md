# Trading Decision Summary for ETH-USD

**Trader's Proposal:**
- **Action:** HOLD
- **Justification:** The recent 5-day variation in ETH-USD indicates a significant decrease of 9.49%, suggesting market volatility and a downward trend. The trader recommended a HOLD position due to a lack of clear indicators for a strong rebound or further decline, advising waiting for either stabilization or confirmation of a trend reversal.
- **Suggested Order Size:** 50 shares

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Risk Level:** Moderate
- **Volatility:** 30-day annualized volatility rate at 30%, which is below the critical threshold of 50%.
- **Comment:** The proposal to hold 50 shares falls within acceptable risk levels. The proposed order size meets the maximum allowable limit but should be approached with caution due to policy rules on order size limits.

**Compliance Check:**
- **Compliance Status:** Non-compliant
- **Issues Identified:**
  - Cryptocurrency trading, such as ETH-USD, requires explicit authorization from Compliance, which has not been secured.
  - Although the order size is exactly at the upper limit and does not require adjustment, the crucial issue is the lack of necessary authorization from Compliance.

**Final Order Decision:**
The proposed HOLD order for 50 shares of ETH-USD is presently not compliant due to the absence of explicit authorization from Compliance for cryptocurrency trading. Further action is needed to address this compliance issue before proceeding.
