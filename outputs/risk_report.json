{"ticker":"ETH-USD","risk_level":"moderate","volatility":30.0,"comment":"The proposal to hold 50 shares is within acceptable risk levels given the 30-day annualized volatility of 30%, which is below the 50% threshold. However, the order size meets the maximum allowable limit of 50 shares, so caution is advised to ensure no adjustments are needed per policy rules on order size limits."}
